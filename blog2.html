        <div class="firstpara">We Know about arrays and objects in javascript we may consider that both are two different things and we extensively use them in javascript 

            But in fact array is a special type of object let see how this notion will becomes true
            :</div>
        <div class="lastparab2">
            Usually in order to get property values in objects we will get them through  dot notation and bracket notation like object.fullname this will give the value of fullname which belongs to the object.<br/>
            If you observe the things carefully  one  can know that  here if dot notation is dealing with objects and at  the same time same dot notation is dealing with arrays too like array.length()<br/>
           
           So we are accessing length() method from the object array and here method is a functions written in inside the javascript objects<br/>
           
           To make things even more clear just log the typeof([1,2,3,4]) you will get output as objects that is how you can cross check you answer<br/>
           Again here we did the console.log(typeof([1,2,3,4])) . If you observe this particular thing you can realize that we are accessing log methods from the console object.<br/>
           
           So finally what I'm saying is  we learned that arrays and objects are like two different things but two are the same. array is a special type of objects in javascript
