    <h1> <span>Functions</span> are the building blocks of programming languages:</h1>
    <div>
    <div>
      <p>
        <div class="firstpara">If you are a new beginner to the programming language you will start
        your journey with calling the function. At this moment we do not
        understand this. What i'm trying to saying is we did not know that we
        are started with functions Lets see how we start with functions by
        taking two programming languages as an example:</div>
        <div class="midpara">
        Python:<br />
        print(“Hello world”)<br />
        Java script:<br />
        console.log(‘Hello world’)<br /></div>
      <div class="lastpara">
        If you observe the above lines of code we can tell that we are calling
        some functions like print,log with passing some arguments so that is how
        we used the function in our early journey itself. We all know what we
        will get output from that function.
        <br />
        Those are inbuilt functions that are already written by respective
        programming language communities. You will understand in your journey
        that is functions are the building blocks of any programming languages
        <br />
        Now ask any of your known pro developer how to maintain clean code he
        will surely mentions about usage of extensive function in codes
        <br />
        Because a pro developers always tries for non repetitive things in code
        so they will use functions extensively that will make their code simple
        and precise
        <br />
        So every developer needs to maintain non repetitiveness in their codes,
        that is how they will become efficient code writers in the market that
        is where functions will help us to become good coders.
